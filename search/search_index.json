Transmission should only run while the VPN is active and any disconnect from VPN should cause Transmission to stop. The container should provide community best practices on how to configure the kill switch, firewall and tweaks on the OpenVPN configs to make it run as fast and secure as possible. It goes like this \u00b6 To understand how it works, this is the most important events and who/what starts them. You start the container The container starts OpenVPN OpenVPN starts/stops Transmission When you start the container it is instructed to run a script to start OpenVPN. This is defined in the Dockerfile . This script is responsible for doing initial setup and prepare what is needed for OpenVPN to run successfully. Starting OpenVPN \u00b6 The main purpose of the startup script is to figure out which OpenVPN config to use. OpenVPN itself can be started with a single argument, and that is the config file. We also add a few more to tell it to start Transmission when the VPN tunnel is started and to stop Transmission when OpenVPN is stopped. That's it. Apart from that the script does some firewall config, vpn interface setup and possibly other things based on your settings. There are also some reserved script names that a user can mount/add to the container to include their own scripts as a part of the setup or teardown of the container. Anyways! You have probably seen the docker run and docker-compose configuration examples and you've put two and two together: This is where environment variables comes in. Setting environment variables is a common way to pass configuration options to containers and it is the way we have chosen to do it here. So far we've explained the need for OPENVPN_PROVIDER and OPENVPN_CONFIG . We use the combination of these two to find the right config. OPENVPN_CONFIG is not set as a mandatory option as each provider should have a default config that will be used if none is set. With the config file identified we're ready to start OpenVPN, the only thing missing are probably a username and password. There are some free providers out there, but they are the exceptions to the rule. We have to inject the username/password into the config somehow. Again there are exceptions but the majority of configs from regular providers contain a line with auth-user-pass which will make OpenVPN prompt for username and password when you start a connection. That will obviously not work for us so we need to modify that option. If it's followed by a path to a file, it will read the first line of that file as username and the second line as password. You provide your username and password as OPENVPN_USERNAME and OPENVPN_PASSWORD . These will be written into two lines in a file called /config/openvpn-credentials.txt on startup by the start script. Having written your username/password to a file, we can successfully start OpenVPN. Starting Transmission \u00b6 We're using the up option from OpenVPN to start Transmission. --up cmd Run command cmd after successful TUN/TAP device open This means that Transmission will be started when OpenVPN has connected successfully and opened the tunnel device. We are having OpenVPN call the tunnelUp.sh script which in turn will call the start scripts for Transmission and Tinyproxy . The up script will be called with a number of parameters from OpenVPN, and among them is the IP of the tunnel interface. This IP is the one we've been assigned by DHCP from the OpenVPN server we're connecting to. We use this value to override Transmissions bind address, so we'll only listen for traffic from peers on the VPN interface. The startup script checks to see if one of the alternative web ui's should be used for Transmission. It also sets up the user that Transmission should be run as, based on the PUID and PGID passed by the user along with selecting preferred logging output and a few other tweaks. Before starting Transmission we also need to see if there are any settings that should be overridden. One example of this is binding Transmission to the IP we've gotten from our VPN provider. Here we check if we find any environment variables that match a setting that we also see in settings.json. This is described in the config section . Setting a matching environment variable will then override the setting in Transmission. OpenVPN does not pass the environment variables it was started with to Transmission. To still be able to access them when starting Transmission, we're writing the ones we need to a file when starting OpenVPN. That way we can read them back and use them here. With the environment variables in place this script then overwrites the selected properties in settings.json and we're ready to start Transmission itself. After starting Transmission there is an optional step that some providers have; to get an open port and set it in Transmission. Opening a port in your local router does not work . I made that bold because it's a recurring theme. It's not intuitive until it is I guess. Since all your traffic is going through the VPN, which is kind of the point, the port you have to open is not on your router. Your router's external IP address is the destination of those packets. It is on your VPN providers end that it has to be opened. Some providers support this, other don't. We try to write scripts for those that do and that script will be executed after starting Transmission if it exists for your provider. At this point Transmission is running and everything is great!

OPENVPN_CONFIG=UK Southampton OPENVPN_OPTS Will be passed to OpenVPN on startup See OpenVPN doc LOCAL_NETWORK Sets the local network that should have access. Accepts comma separated list. LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/24 CREATE_TUN_DEVICE Creates /dev/net/tun device inside the container, mitigates the need mount the device from the host CREATE_TUN_DEVICE=true Timezone option \u00b6 Set a custom timezone in tz database format. Look here for a list of valid timezones. Defaults to UTC. Variable Function Example TZ Set Timezone TZ=UTC Firewall configuration options \u00b6 When enabled, the firewall blocks everything except traffic to the peer port and traffic to the rpc port from the LOCAL_NETWORK and the internal docker gateway. If TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_ON_START is enabled then it allows traffic to the range of peer ports defined by TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_HIGH and TRANSMISSION_PEER_PORT_RANDOM_LOW. Variable Function Example ENABLE_UFW Enables the firewall ENABLE_UFW=true UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET Allows the gateway network through the firewall. Off defaults to only allowing the gateway. UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET=true UFW_EXTRA_PORTS Allows the comma separated list of ports through the firewall. Respects UFW_ALLOW_GW_NET. UFW_EXTRA_PORTS=9910,23561,443 UFW_DISABLE_IPTABLES_REJECT Prevents the use of REJECT in the iptables rules, for hosts without the ipt_REJECT module (such as the Synology NAS). UFW_DISABLE_IPTABLES_REJECT=true Health check option \u00b6 Because your VPN connection can sometimes fail, Docker will run a health check on this container every 5 minutes to see if the container is still connected to the internet. By default, this check is done by pinging google.com once. You change the host that is pinged. Variable Function Example HEALTH_CHECK_HOST this host is pinged to check if the network connection still works google.com Permission configuration options \u00b6 By default the startup script applies a default set of permissions and ownership on the transmission download, watch and incomplete directories. The GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS directive can be used to disable this functionality. Variable Function Example GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS Disable setting of default permissions GLOBAL_APPLY_PERMISSIONS=false Alternative web UIs \u00b6 You can override the default web UI by setting the TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME environment variable. If set, Transmission will look there for the Web Interface files, such as the javascript, html, and graphics files. Combustion UI , Kettu and Transmission-Web-Control come bundled with the container. You can enable either of them by setting TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=combustion , TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=kettu or TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=transmission-web-control , respectively. Note that this will override the TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME variable if set. Variable Function Example TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME Set Transmission web home TRANSMISSION_WEB_HOME=/path/to/web/ui TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI Use the specified bundled web UI TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=combustion , TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=kettu or TRANSMISSION_WEB_UI=transmission-web-control Transmission configuration options \u00b6 You may override Transmission options by setting the appropriate environment variable. The environment variables are the same name as used in the transmission settings.json file and follow the format given in these examples: Transmission variable name Environment variable name speed-limit-up TRANSMISSION_SPEED_LIMIT_UP speed-limit-up-enabled TRANSMISSION_SPEED_LIMIT_UP_ENABLED ratio-limit TRANSMISSION_RATIO_LIMIT ratio-limit-enabled TRANSMISSION_RATIO_LIMIT_ENABLED As you can see the variables are prefixed with TRANSMISSION_ , the variable is capitalized, and - is converted to _ . Transmission options changed in the WebUI or in settings.json will be overridden at startup and will not survive after a reboot of the container. You may want to use these variables in order to keep your preferences. PS: TRANSMISSION_BIND_ADDRESS_IPV4 will be overridden to the IP assigned to your OpenVPN tunnel interface. This is to prevent leaking the host IP. User configuration options \u00b6 By default everything will run as the root user. However, it is possible to change who runs the transmission process. You may set the following parameters to customize the user id that runs transmission. Variable Function Example PUID Sets the user id who will run transmission PUID=1003 PGID Sets the group id for the transmission user PGID=1003 Dropping default route from iptables (advanced) \u00b6 Some VPNs do not override the default route, but rather set other routes with a lower metric. This might lead to the default route (your untunneled connection) to be used. To drop the default route set the environment variable DROP_DEFAULT_ROUTE to true . Note : This is not compatible with all VPNs. You can check your iptables routing with the ip r command in a running container. Changing logging locations \u00b6 By default Transmission will log to a file in TRANSMISSION_HOME/transmission.log . To log to stdout instead set the environment variable LOG_TO_STDOUT to true . Note : By default stdout is what container engines read logs from. Set this to true to have Tranmission logs in commands like docker logs and kubectl logs . OpenVPN currently only logs to stdout. Custom scripts \u00b6 If you ever need to run custom code before or after transmission is executed or stopped, you can use the custom scripts feature. Custom scripts are located in the /scripts directory which is empty by default. To enable this feature, you'll need to mount the /scripts directory. Once /scripts is mounted you'll need to write your custom code in the following bash shell scripts: Script Function /scripts/openvpn-pre-start.sh This shell script will be executed before openvpn start /scripts/transmission-pre-start.sh This shell script will be executed before transmission start /scripts/transmission-post-start.sh This shell script will be executed after transmission start /scripts/transmission-pre-stop.sh This shell script will be executed before transmission stop /scripts/transmission-post-stop.sh This shell script will be executed after transmission stop Don't forget to include the #!/bin/bash shebang and to make the scripts executable using chmod a+x","title":"Configuration options"},{"location":"config-options/#required_environment_options","text":"Variable Function Example OPENVPN_PROVIDER Sets the OpenVPN provider to use.

What if you use docker run --privileged , do you still get that error? This is an error where we haven't got too much information. If the hints above get you nowhere, create an issue. Container loses connection after some time \u00b6 For some users, on some platforms, apparently this is an issue. I have not encountered this myself - but there is no doubt that it's recurring. Why does the container lose connectivity? That we don't know and it could be many different reasons that manifest the same symptoms. We do however have some possible solutions. Set the ping-exit option for OpenVPN and restart-flag in Docker \u00b6 Most provider configs have a ping-restart option set. So if the tunnel fails, OpenVPN will restart and re-connect. That works well on regular systems. The problem is that if the container has lost internet connection restarting OpenVPN will not fix anything. What you can do though is to set/override this option using OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60 . This will tell OpenVPN to exit when it cannot ping the server for 1 minute. When OpenVPN exits, the container will exit. And if you've then set restart=always or restart=unless-stopped in your Docker config then Docker will restart the container and that could/should restore connectivity. VPN providers sometime push options to their clients after they connect. This is visible in the logs if they do. If they push ping-restart that can override your settings. So you could consider adding --pull-filter ignore ping to the options above. This approach will probably work, especially if you're seeing logs like these from before: Inactivity timeout (--ping-restart), restarting SIGUSR1[soft,ping-restart] received, process restarting Use a third party tool to monitor and restart the container \u00b6 The container has a health check script that is run periodically. It will report the health status to Docker and the container will show as \"unhealthy\" if basic network connectivity is broken. You can write your own script and add it to cron, or you can use a tool like https://hub.docker.com/r/willfarrell/autoheal/ to look for and restart unhealthy containers. AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED \u00b6 If your logs end like this, the wrong username/password was sent to your VPN provider. AUTH: Received control message: AUTH_FAILED SIGTERM[soft,auth-failure] received, process exiting We can divide the possible errors here into three. You have entered the wrong credentials, the server has some kind of error or the container has messed up your credentials. We have had challenges with special characters. Having \"?= as part of your password has tripped up our scripts from time to time. First check that your credentials are correct. Some providers have separate credentials for OpenVPN so it might not be the same as for their apps. Secondly, test a few different servers just to make sure that it's not just a faulty server. If this doesn't resolve it, it's probably the container. To verify this you can mount a volume to /config in the container. So for example /temporary/folder:/config . Your credentials will be written to /config/openvpn-credentials.txt when the container starts, more on that here . So by mounting this folder you will be able to check the contents of that text file. The first line should be your username, the second should be your password. This file is what's passed to OpenVPN. If your username/password is correct here than you should probably contact your provider.","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"faq/#the_container_runs_but_i_cant_access_the_web_ui","text":"TODO : Short explanation and link to networking","title":"The container runs, but I can't access the web ui"},{"location":"faq/#how_do_i_verify_that_my_traffic_is_using_vpn","text":"There are many ways of doing this, and I welcome you to add to this list if you have any suggestsions.

What you can do though is to set/override this option using OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60 . This will tell OpenVPN to exit when it cannot ping the server for 1 minute. When OpenVPN exits, the container will exit. And if you've then set restart=always or restart=unless-stopped in your Docker config then Docker will restart the container and that could/should restore connectivity. VPN providers sometime push options to their clients after they connect. This is visible in the logs if they do. If they push ping-restart that can override your settings. So you could consider adding --pull-filter ignore ping to the options above. This approach will probably work, especially if you're seeing logs like these from before: Inactivity timeout (--ping-restart), restarting SIGUSR1[soft,ping-restart] received, process restarting","title":"Set the ping-exit option for OpenVPN and restart-flag in Docker"},{"location":"faq/#use_a_third_party_tool_to_monitor_and_restart_the_container","text":"The container has a health check script that is run periodically.

Some providers have separate credentials for OpenVPN so it might not be the same as for their apps. Secondly, test a few different servers just to make sure that it's not just a faulty server. If this doesn't resolve it, it's probably the container. To verify this you can mount a volume to /config in the container. So for example /temporary/folder:/config .

The benefit of choosing yourself is that you can choose a region that is closer to you and that might be better for speed. I also believe that tinkering with this builds some familiarity with the image and some confidence and understanding for future debugging. We're now moving towards a setup where we download the configs for our providers when the container starts.

A tip for finding out is to set OPENVPN_CONFIG=dummy and start it. This will fail, but in the logs it will print all the valid options. Pro tip: choose multiple servers. For example: OPENVPN_CONFIG=france,sweden,austria,italy,belgium This will ensure a location near you, but at the same time it will allow some redundancy. Set Docker to restart the container automatically and you have a failover mechanism.

The short story is that /24 will allow for any value in the last digit place while /16 will allow any value in the two last places. Be sure to only allow IPs that are in the private IP ranges . This option punches a hole in the VPN for the IPs that you specify. It is neccessary to reach your Web UI but narrower ranges are better than wide ones. With that said. If you know that you're on a \"typical\" network with your router at 192.168.1.1, then LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.1.0/24 is better than LOCAL_NETWORK=192.168.0.0/16 .

For example if they come with a ca.crt file that is referenced in the config you need to update this reference to the path it will have inside the container (which is /etc/openvpn/...). You also have to set where to look for your username/password. There is a script called adjustConfigs.sh that could help you.

For some providers, like AirVPN, the .ovpn files are generated per user and contains credentials. They should not be added to a public image. This is what you do: Add a new volume mount to your docker run command that mounts your config file: -v /path/to/your/config.ovpn:/etc/openvpn/custom/default.ovpn Then you can set OPENVPN_PROVIDER=CUSTOM and the container will use the config you provided.

Change it for auth-user-pass /config/openvpn-credentials.txt which is the file where your OPENVPN_USERNAME and OPENVPN_PASSWORD variables will be written to.

One way of doing this is to set environment variable OPENVPN_OPTS=--inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60 and use the --restart=always flag when starting the container.

Reach sleep or hybernation on your host if no torrents are active \u00b6 By befault Transmission will always scrape trackers, even if all torrents have completed their activities, or they have been paused manually. This will cause Transmission to be always active, therefore never allow your host server to be inactive and go to sleep/hybernation/whatever. If this is something you want, you can add the following variable when creating the container. It will turn off a hidden setting in Tranmsission which will stop the application to scrape trackers for paused torrents. Transmission will become inactive, and your host will reach the desidered state. -e \"TRANSMISSION_SCRAPE_PAUSED_TORRENTS_ENABLED=false\" Running it on a NAS \u00b6 Several popular NAS platforms supports Docker containers. You should be able to set up and configure this container using their web interfaces. As of version 3.0 of this image creates a TUN interface inside the container by default. This previously had to be mounted from the host which was an issue for some NAS servers. The assumption is that this should now be fixed. If you have issues and the logs seem to blame \"/dev/net/tun\" in some way then you might consider trying to mount a host device and see if that works better. Setting up a TUN device is probably easiest to accomplish by installing an OpenVPN package for the NAS. This should set up the device and you can mount it. Systemd Integration \u00b6 On many modern linux systems, including Ubuntu, systemd can be used to start the transmission-openvpn at boot time, and restart it after any failure. Save the following as /etc/systemd/system/transmission-openvpn.service , and replace the OpenVPN PROVIDER/USERNAME/PASSWORD directives with your settings, and add any other directives that you're using. This service is assuming that there is a bittorrent user set up with a home directory at /home/bittorrent/ . The data directory will be mounted at /home/bittorrent/data/ . This can be changed to whichever user and location you're using. OpenVPN is set to exit if there is a connection failure. OpenVPN exiting triggers the container to also exit, then the Restart=always definition in the transmission-openvpn.service file tells systems to restart things again.

Transmission will become inactive, and your host will reach the desidered state. -e \"TRANSMISSION_SCRAPE_PAUSED_TORRENTS_ENABLED=false\"","title":"Reach sleep or hybernation on your host if no torrents are active"},{"location":"tips-tricks/#running_it_on_a_nas","text":"Several popular NAS platforms supports Docker containers. You should be able to set up and configure this container using their web interfaces. As of version 3.0 of this image creates a TUN interface inside the container by default. This previously had to be mounted from the host which was an issue for some NAS servers. The assumption is that this should now be fixed. If you have issues and the logs seem to blame \"/dev/net/tun\" in some way then you might consider trying to mount a host device and see if that works better. Setting up a TUN device is probably easiest to accomplish by installing an OpenVPN package for the NAS. This should set up the device and you can mount it.","title":"Running it on a NAS"},{"location":"tips-tricks/#systemd_integration","text":"On many modern linux systems, including Ubuntu, systemd can be used to start the transmission-openvpn at boot time, and restart it after any failure. Save the following as /etc/systemd/system/transmission-openvpn.service , and replace the OpenVPN PROVIDER/USERNAME/PASSWORD directives with your settings, and add any other directives that you're using. This service is assuming that there is a bittorrent user set up with a home directory at /home/bittorrent/ . The data directory will be mounted at /home/bittorrent/data/ . This can be changed to whichever user and location you're using. OpenVPN is set to exit if there is a connection failure. OpenVPN exiting triggers the container to also exit, then the Restart=always definition in the transmission-openvpn.service file tells systems to restart things again.

Hobby projects often get last in line for some love and care, and it took longer than I hoped but here we are. Some highlights on version 3.0: We're dropping the ubuntu based image and making alpine the default (reduce double maintenance) We're making Transmission settings persistent by default, removing the need for all the environment variables (but keeping support for it) We're making it easier to provide your own OpenVPN (.ovpn) config file - adding scripts in the container to modify provider configs as needed to fit the container setup. (still in early stages at this point) We're adding a standardized way to add scripts for doing necessary setup of a provider. This usually means to download a .ovpn config bundle, unpack it and modify it correctly to work in this container. Hopefully these changes will improve the usability of this container. As maintainers we also hope that it will free up time to keep the container up to date and stable instead of managing thousands of .ovpn files coming and going. I'll try to keep a list of breaking changes here, and add to it if we come across more: The CREATE_TUN_DEVICE variable now defaults to true. Mounting /dev/net/tun will lead to an error message in the logs unless you explicitly set it to false. The DOCKER_LOG variable is renamed to LOG_TO_STDOUT If Transmission is running but you can't connect to torrents, try deleting (or rename to .backup) the settings.json file and restart. PS: Now more than ever. We appreciate that you report bugs and issues when you find them. But as there might be more than ususal, please make sure you search and look for a similar one before possibly creating a duplicate. And you can always revert back to the latest tag on the 2.x versions which is 2.14. Instead of running with haugene/transmission-openvpn simply use haugene/transmission-openvpn:2.14 instead.
